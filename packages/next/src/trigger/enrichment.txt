Explanation/Docs on Enrichment Task

The enrichment system processes leads in two different ways based on email type:

1. Company Email Pipeline
- For emails using company domains (e.g., @company.com)
- Uses Apollo and LinkedIn directly
- Extracts company and person data
- Updates company research data if needed

2. Personal Email Pipeline (2-step approach)
a) First Attempt: ExaLabs + Apollo
- Searches both platforms for the person
- Matches profiles using similarity scoring
- If found, gets LinkedIn data
- Updates company research data

b) Fallback: Google Dork Search
- Only used if ExaLabs search fails
- Uses Google to find LinkedIn profile
- Gets Apollo and LinkedIn data
- Updates company research data
